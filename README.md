This repository contains an example Golang program used to illustrate
table-driven tests, automated build, and unit test code coverage.

The library provides a simple function for converting Roman numerals
(in string form) into numbers. At the moment it works for valid Roman
numerals, but does not flag any invalid input.

See the accompanying LICENSE file for usage information.
